Q2D3
----

This is a prototype that illustrates how to use the QIIME 2 SDK to build an interface. This is based on the earlier [q2d2](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/q2d2) prototype.

As this is a prototype, you shouldn't rely on any of the code in this subpackage. This code will be removed in favor of production-ready interfaces in the near future.
