# QIIME 2

This repository houses the QIIME 2 project, which is currently in early alpha stage. QIIME 2 will be changing rapidly over the next few months, so we don't recommend depending on this for important analysis. In the meantime, you should continue to use [QIIME 1](http://www.qiime.org) and [Qiita](http://qiita.microbio.me). 

For updates on QIIME 2, you should [follow @qiime_ on twitter](https://twitter.com/qiime_).

To learn about where we're going with QIIME 2, see @gregcaporaso's blog post, [Toward QIIME 2](http://blog.qiime.org/toward-qiime-2), and  video, [q2d2: A public QIIME 2 prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kllTtKWr5HQ).
