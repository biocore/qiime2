    # of ipywidgets (which is included in our plugins that utilize seaborn).
    # As of 2018.01.04, the build of html5lib on conda-forge breaks deployments
    # of QIIME 2 when using conda 4.4. This `run_constrained` directive ensures
    # that if html5lib is to be installed, it uses the defaults channel.
